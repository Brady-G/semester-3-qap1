# Semester 3 QAP 1 Fullstack Javascript

Welcome, this is my submission for QAP 1

### How to run
You can either run the files manually, or you can use the npm runs I set up as such.

For task 1 you can run either the node.js commands or use the individual runs like such, ive also provided a single run that will run all the individual runs for task 1 which is `npm run task1` if you do not want to use that you can use the runs below:
- `npm run buffer`
- `npm run process`
- `npm run console`

For task 2 there is only one file so it has just one single run command it is `npm run task2`, for this task I used moment and displayed a variety of ways to do dates with it.
